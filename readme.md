Run the program with the '-h' or '--help' flag to view usage details.

This program takes a file, converts its data to a Markov chain, and outputs a randomly generated string of data. (For more info on Markov chains, see [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).) Specifically, this program allows for variable length n-grams (i.e. users may control "the randomness" the output) and variable length output.

TODO: Abstract this program so that it can build Markov chains and generate data for sources other than text files.
